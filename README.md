# SDEs[^1]
Visualizations and experiments of 4 stochastic differential equations - Ornstein Uhlenbeck,
Feller Diffusion, and two novel SDEs based on a diagonal matrix completion problem. You can
download my report using the `sdes_paper.pdf` file.

To try running it yourself, clone the repository and run `main.ipynb`. 
I didn't include a requirements file, but the only external packages you need are

1. `numpy`
2. `scikit-learn`
3. `matplotlib`

Just `pip install <pkg-name>` them all.
